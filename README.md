Smart Shop

**Smart Shop** is a lightweight e-commerce Flutter application built as a demo project to showcase key concepts in state management, data persistence, theming, and API integration. It utilizes modern Flutter practices like `Provider` for state management, `SharedPreferences` for local storage, and RESTful API consumption using the [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com).



## Features

### Authentication

* Login & Registration screens with `TextFormField` validation
* Splash screen that checks login state
* Persistent login using `SharedPreferences`
* Dummy user data or optional use of FakeStore API

### Favourites Page
